# Week 1 Assignment — Quantum Measurement Dataset Foundations

This repository contains my Week 1 assignment solution for quantum measurement dataset foundations, including:
- Measurement model construction (Pauli projective)
- Single-qubit measurement dataset generation (saved artifacts)
- Single-qubit tomography reconstruction + validation plots + metrics summary

## Repository structure
- `src/` : helper code (if any)
- `docs/` : documentation and notes
- `notebooks/Assignment_1.ipynb` : main notebook (Run All)
- `data/` : generated measurement datasets and density matrices
- `outputs/` : summary tables and validation artifacts

## How to run
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
